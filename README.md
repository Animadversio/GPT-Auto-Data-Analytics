Automatize local data analysis with groups of tool-using GPT agents

A data analysis project is usually motivated by a high level question and then break it down into 

## TODO
* [x] Terminate the loop properly and avoid repeated run of loop. 
* [x] Demo dataset of for data analysis from Kaggle. Mar. 3
* [ ] **Presentation** Nicer way to summarize results, code and figures into a nice looking report for human to read, instead of reading through the debugging history. 
* [ ] **ipynb report**
    * [x] Export a ipynb type output from recorded analysis chat history!  @Mar 10
    * [x] support multi media outputs (table, image) in the captured output and export! @Mar 10
    * [ ] Export a ipynb type output from the system, record. Build up the ipynb in the process
* [ ] Design file structure for storing analysis results. 
* [ ] Multi agent tool chat, one assigning tasks and objectives the other execute it. 
* [ ] Add memory slot, let it remember the objective. 
* [ ] Multi file complex system analysis project.
