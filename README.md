# GPT-Auto-Data-Analytics
Automate local data analysis with groups of tool-using GPT agents. 

<!-- A data analysis project is usually motivated by a high level question and then break it down into  -->

<!-- ## üöÄ Current Project Status: Transforming Data Analysis

Here's a glimpse of the magic happening behind the scenes: -->

### ‚úÖ üåü Current Features

- **Auto Analytics in Local Env:** The coding agent have access to a local python kernel, which interact and runs code on your computer. No more worry about file upload, compute and environment limit of the online ChatGPT code interpreter. Arbitrary python library or compute can be leveraged. 
- **Collaborative Intelligence:** We build a team of LLM agents, assuming the role of research supervisor and coding assistant. Through their interaction, we let the higher level big picture of the supervisor guide the detailed coding and data analysis process of coding assistant, forming a coherent report. 
- **Tabular Dataset Analysis:** We have full support of tabular data analysis (e.g. Kaggle). From tables to analytical insights is one step away. 
- **Vision Analytics:** Vision API integration empowers the data analytics agent to generate figures and understand the meaning of plots in a closed loop.
- **Versatile Report Export:** After automated data analysis, a jupyter notebook is generated combining code, results, and visuals in a narrative that tells the story of your data. Jupyter notebooks, PDF and HTML formats export for your review and reproduction. 

### üåê What's Next?
- [ ] Enhanced report presentation. 
- [ ] CLI interface to auto data analysis. 
- [ ] Tackle complex, multi-file nested data analysis projects.
- [ ] Enhance more iterations of communication between supervisor and coding agent. 

## Join Us on This Journey
As an end goal, we hope our tools can auto-pilot data analysis on its own. 
If you are interested in using our tool in your daily data analysis work or scientific research, let me know what you think and find hard!
